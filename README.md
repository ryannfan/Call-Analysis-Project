# Call-Analysis-Project

# Description
New York City publishes a number of open datasets for public consumption or use. Amongst them is a dataset consisting of calls to the 311 phone number for non-emergency services. Each call to 311 has a number of datapoints tracked and aggregated. We have worked with a yearâ€™s worth of data from this dataset and answered a number of questions about it.

Our repository contains two jupyter notebooks.

In the first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we have analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in the zip code of 10027, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. 

In the second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we have analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the zip coed of 10027, they are in general. Specifically, we have computed the total number of parking incidents in 10027, and the total number of all incidents, and found that this fraction is smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes.
